# Fenrirs-Revenge
The first attempt at making a simple rpg in Unity. Currently the game has a very simple AI that paths towards you and damages when you're in range, a stylized large map with post-processing effects, and two levels where the objective is to collect weapons. The game is currently unfinished. Plans to continue development have been put on hold.
